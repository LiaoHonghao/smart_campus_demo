## Project Introduction

In this project, we use human pose estimation algorithms and target detection algorithms to implement a people monitoring and management system for campus, including the main functions like **people motion recognition**, **intruder recognition**, and **abnormal situation recognition** (e.g., crowding, fighting, and climbing over walls). The system is deployed for use in campus surveillance systems.

## Demonstration

Due to the privacy problem and the limited permission, only some of the project's demos are shown here.
